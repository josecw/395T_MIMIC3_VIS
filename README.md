## Task  
Develop 5 figures to create a visual gallery based on MIMIC data using python.  

## Instructions  
Select from the MIMIC III dataset. If you do not have full access yet, you can use demo data. Use it to create 5 different visualizations in Python. You saw examples of how to create these visualizations in Lecture Series 4.2.Links to an external site. You will receive partial credit for recreating exactly the same examples from the lecture. You will get full credit for using different tables, visualizations, and analyses. See the rubric for more information. 

Once you complete your visualizations in Python, create a set of slides that explains each one. The slides should have enough detail so that your peers could rebuild your work. You can use Google Slides or PowerPoint to create these. Office 365Links to an external site. is free for all UT Austin students.
